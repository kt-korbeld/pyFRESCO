# pyFRESCO
This is a python implementation of the DistributeFoldx/DistributeRosetta/FarEnoughZone scripts written by Hein Wijma.
This implementation includes some quality of life improvements that reduce the amounts of inputs needed, 
standardizes the input format between the two scrips, and includes a few additional warnings and error messages. 
This program is intended to distribute the calculation of a large number of mutations by FoldX and Rosetta ddg_monomer.
For the first phase of preparing the files for calculations, use a command like:

```
python DistributeFoldX.py Phase1 MyPrecious.pdb MyPreciousSelection.tab 100 /home/wijma/Fold_X/FoldX.linux64
```
or 
```
python DistributeRosettaddg.py Phase1 MyPrecious.pdb MyPreciousSelection.tab 100 FLAGrow3 /home/wijma/mini20101104/mini/bin/fix_bb_monomer_ddg.linuxgccrelease
```

This should PREPARE mutations of MyPrecious.pdb for residues specified in the File MyPreciousSelection.tab and 
distribute them over directories with each a 100 different mutations. For the second phase of collecting the results into a list, use a command like:

```
python DistributeFoldX.py Phase2 MyPrecious.pdb -5
```
or 
```
python DistributeRosetta.py Phase2 MyPrecious.pdb -5
```

This should COLLECT the mutations of MyPrecious.pdb assuming a cutoff of -5 KJ mol-1,resulting in FOUR lists:
- a complete list of all mutations
- a list of the mutations that are less than -5 kJ mol-1
- a list with the best mutation per position
- a list with the best mutation per position that are less than -5 kJ mol-1

The generation of the `MyPreciousSelection.tab` file can be done manually, making sure all selected residues are in the format:
```
I A 5
E A 6
Q A 7
[...]
E B 141
A B 142
D B 144
END
```
where the first column is the residue, the second column the chain identifier, and the last column the residue number. 
Alternatively, the `FarEnoughZone.py` script can be used to generate the list automatically, excluding all residues within given radius of a ligand or cofactor. 
For example to generate a .tab file with all residues at least 5Ã… from the ligand HPN, use:
```
python FarEnoughZone.py --pdb myprecious.pdb --residue 'HPN' --distance 5 --output MyPreciousSelection.tab
```
The Distribute scripts makes use of `numpy` python package, and the FarEnoughZone script makes use of the `MDAnalysis` python package. 
If needed, the Distribute scripts accept the original input format as specified in the step-by-step protocol published at doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4939-7366-8_5 by setting the variable `LEGACY` to `True` inside the script.
